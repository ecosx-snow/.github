The **SNOW (Shuttle NO Wait)** project was initiated by the ECOSX team to provide low-cost chip services to university research groups, research institutes, open source communities, and start-ups, supporting them in chip innovation and talent training. SNOW is positioned as **"affordable and fast"** and aims to **"achieve 90% PPA in 10% of the time and cost"**. It can be used as a small-scale trial production tape-out service between FPGA prototype system verification and large-scale mass production. After users achieve small-scale trial production with chips with 90% PPA and complete perliminary system demonstration or market promotion, they can optimize the ultimate PPA in the large-scale mass production stage.
